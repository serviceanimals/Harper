My personal water quality specialist (water offered by me; distilled, +filtered well water, +onTapWater), Service dog [Natolie Harper](https://serviceanimals.github.io/Harper/) was shot dead with two slugs while working at my side on December 1st 2020 at 4:30 pm by Flint City Police while I was using the bus terminal downtown [MTA](https://mtaflint.org/).  She is dead.  Shot twice, neck and pelvis.  She was a good dog.  She was an exceptional coder and skilled worker who was killed while working.  Can you please assist?

Why was Harper a great water quality specialist?
1.  She would not forge data like city employed personel did!  Why were the forging personel set free @nocost?  Is this why my friend canine Harper is not among us?
1.  She would NOT drink tainted water.  She would drink good water.

Harper riding a city bus.  In a city like Flint Michigan that is suffering from a water crisis, shouldn't more people have water quality specialists at their side?  How do you make a superb water quality specialist from a dog?

1.  Ensure that all of the dog's bowls are made of glass.
1.  Fill the bowls with different kinds of water, including tap and bottled water.  Also fill a bowl with whole milk (Michigan PBB milk contamination incident) and more glass bowls with dog (dry and wet) and human food.

Harper playing in the Flint River.  Please note the color of the river.  This unpleasant septic tank coloration and the missing **fish are inedible** signs can be changed in the short of time.  Do you have an aquarium at home?  Does it have an aerator?  There is a balance between aerobic and anaerobic microbial life.  Aeration helps aerobic life thrive.
