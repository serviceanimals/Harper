# Water Quality Specialist

My personal water quality specialist (water offered by me; distilled, +filtered well water, +onTapWater), Service dog [Natalie Harper](https://serviceanimals.github.io/Harper/) was shot dead with two slugs while working at my side on December 1st 2020 at 4:30 pm by Flint City Police while I was using the bus terminal downtown [MTA](https://mtaflint.org/).  She is dead.  Shot twice, neck and pelvis.  She was a good dog.  She was an exceptional coder and skilled worker who was killed while working.  Can you please assist?

Why was Natalie Harper a great water quality specialist?
1.  She would not forge data like city employed personnel did!  Why were the forging personnel set free @nocost?  Is this why my friend canine Natalie Harper is not among us?
1.  She would NOT drink tainted water.  She would drink good water.

Natalie Harper riding a city bus.  In a city like Flint Michigan that is suffering from a water crisis, should not more people have water quality specialists at their side?  How do you make a superb water quality specialist from a dog?

1.  Ensure that all of the dog's bowls are made of glass.
1.  Fill the bowls with different kinds of water, including tap and bottled water.  Also fill a bowl with whole milk (Michigan PBB milk contamination incident) and more glass bowls with dog (dry and wet) and human food.

This unpleasant septic tank coloration and the missing **fish are inedible** signs can be changed in the short of time.  Do you have an aquarium at home?  Does it have an aerator?  There is a balance between aerobic and anaerobic microbial life.  Aeration helps aerobic life thrive.
