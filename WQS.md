My personal water quality specialist (water offered by me; distilled, +filtered well water, +onTapWater), Service dog Natolie Harper was shot dead with two slugs while working at my side at 202012011630 by Flint City Police while I was using the bus terminal downtown [MTA](https://mtaflint.org/).  She is dead.  Shot twice, neck and pelvis.  She was a good dog.  She was an exceptional coder and skilled worker who was killed while working.  Can you please assist?

Why was Harper a great water quality specialist?
1. She would not forge data like city employed personel did!  Why were the forging personel set free @nocost?  Is this why my friend canine Harper is not among us?
1. She would drink good water.  She would NOT drink tainted water.

How do you make a superb water quality specialist from a dog?

1.  Ensure that all of its bowls are made of glass.
1.  Fill the bowls with different kinds of water, milk (Michigan PBB milk contamination incident) and food.

Do you have an aquarium at home?  Does it have an aerator?  There is a balance between aerobic and anaerobic microbial life.  Aeration helps the aerobic life thrive.
