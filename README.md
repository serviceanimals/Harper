# Service dog Natolie Harper Rausty was shot dead with two discharges while working at my side at 202012011630 by Flint City Police

My personal water quality specialist, Service dog Natolie Harper Rausty was shot dead with two slugs while working at my side at 202012011630 by Flint City Police while I was using the bus terminal downtown [MTA](https://mtaflint.org/).  She is dead.  Shot twice, neck and pelvis.  She was a good dog. She was an exceptional coder and skilled worker who was killed while working. Can you please assist?

Why was Harper a great water quality specialist?
1. She would not forge data like city employed personel did!  Why were the forging personel set free @no cost?
1. She drank good water.

[Food as medicine](https://serviceanimals.github.io/FaM/) plus her own canine companion are employed in this battle to control Harper's mange.  Do you see the improvement in Harper's coat?
