My personal [water quality specialist](WQS.md) (water offered by me; distilled, +filtered well water, +onTapWater), Service dog Natalie Harper was shot dead with two slugs while working at my side at 202012011630 by Flint City Police while I was using the bus terminal downtown [MTA](https://mtaflint.org/).  She is dead.  Shot twice, neck and pelvis.  She was a good dog.  She was an exceptional coder and skilled worker who was killed while working.  Can you please assist?

Why was Harper a great water quality specialist?
1. She would not forge data like city employed personel did!  Why were the forging personel set free @nocost?  Is this why my friend canine Harper is not among us?
1. She would drink good water.  She would NOT drink tainted water.

## She was shot dead with two discharges while working at my side at 202012011630 by Flint City Police, Michigan, USA.  Why was my water quality specialist [Service Dog Natalie Harper](https://serviceanimals.github.io/Harper) shot dead by Flint City Police in Michigan USA? 

I have used the Flint MTA in Michigan USA regularly since 2013 with my service dogs as mobility aids, including these dogs being [water quality specialists](https://serviceanimals.github.io/Harper/WQS).  On December 1st at 4pm I was attempting to transfer buses downtown with our amazing friend [service dog Natalie Harper](https://serviceanimals.github.io/Harper/).  I was denied entry for no valid reason.  Other than discrimination, paid leave (Factoring paid leave into Standing && Intimidating smaller stanced sentinent being) comes to mind as well as simple, "You can walk with your dog, but I cannot!"

Service dog Natalie Harper's primary task was mobility aid.  The events that happened at the Flint MTA downtown when I was experiencing them felt completely unreal and detached from points in time.  The [Flint MTA](https://mtaflint.org/) should have this entire event on multiple surveillance cameras as well as my many years of commuting by bus with my service dogs in Flint Michigan, USA.  Natalie Harper was shot across the street after I was told to leave the MTA.  We had left the transit center as requested.

[Food as medicine](https://serviceanimals.github.io/FaM/) plus her own canine companion are employed in this battle to control Harper's mange.  Do you see the improvement in Harper's coat?
